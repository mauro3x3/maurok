Never found the time to complete this book but I can strongly recommend it for anyone interested in the rise of Russia. All things considered, she had very humble beginnings coming from provincial nobility in Stettin and pushed Russia into its golden age. A lot of similarities with Napoleon coming from Corsica. I'd say the book is great example of why Karl Marx became so popular in the following century.
