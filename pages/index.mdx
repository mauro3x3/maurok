**Some things about me:**

- I'm a bachelor student at Aalborg University studying Business Administration and Commercial Law. Planning on taking an MBA in Switzerland or the US after I graduate Q2 2025.
- When I am not studying for school, I am working on bettering myself in the following fields: investing, history, geopolitics, business, data analyst, writing, gym or political prediction markets. 
- I like growing and learning new things. It's a dream of mine to start my own software company and make a positive impact on the world. The development of AI such as Claude or Cursor.ai makes that all the more likely.
- I am interested in geopolitics, international relations, finance, political prediction markets, history, law, gym, religion, investing, technology, startups, and writing. (In no particular order)
