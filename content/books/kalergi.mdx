This is the first time I link an article on my website but I simply fell in love with this piece on Kalergi. You would do yourself a huge favor understanding the vision of Kalergi despite all the low IQ attempts at ruining his legacy.

Richard Kalergi is one of the most interesting figures in European history. I am obsessed with Germanic thinkers and he's just one of them - my reading the last 12 months have been dominated by German thinkers like Kalergi, Spengler, Kissinger and Nietzsche.
