Been holding this book forever, but after watching the anime 'Monster' I got inspired to read it. The main antagonist in the anime is a character who is inspired by Nietzsche's philosophy. The German Ubermensch.

Nietzche attracts a lot of uninteresting and bad people (i.e. fake intellectuals). I am still a huge fan though. I find the arguments between the Christians vs Nietzscheans to be quite intriguing. 

Some of my favorite quotes: 
- "He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster." - This is the plot of the anime 'Monster' and the main character is a doctor who saves a child who turns out to be a monster. The doctor then becomes obsessed with the monster and tries to understand him, but in the process, he could lose his own humanity.
- "Whoever despises himself still respects himself as one who despises." - I love thinking about this and the implications of it.
- "Insanity in individuals is something rare - but in groups, parties, nations and epochs, it is the rule."
- "The one who cannot obey himself will be commanded. That is the nature of living creatures."
- "Verily, I have often laughed at the weaklings who thought themselves good because they had no claws." - This is literally modern Europe. The end of history. No dynamic changes. Just an endless repetition of more bloat. Demographic collapse and a society that has accepted our best days are behind us. Quite pathetic.
