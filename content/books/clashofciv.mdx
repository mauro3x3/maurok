THE fundamental book anyone interested in geopolitics should read. The Muslim world has the most odd borders of any civilization. Touching Christian Europe, Hindu India, Buddhist SEA, Jewish Israel, China and Tribal Africa while being adversarial to all of these. 

The last 200 years Europeans managed to revive 3 historical nations that are destined to be adversaries to the Muslim world:

1) Greece being revived (Turk barrier in Balkans)
2) Israel splitting Arab world
3) India taking South Asia and stopping Islamic expansion to SEA.

I can't see how the Muslim world can prevent inevitable clash with their neighbors for the entire 21st century, if not for leaders moderating forces such as MBS being in charge.
