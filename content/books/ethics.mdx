I have been obsessed with Spinoza since I first discovered him back in 2018 when I would daily bike to the library in pursuit of completing the puzzle in my mind. Growing up in one of the world’s most secular countries, my worldview was thrown into contrast when my first girlfriend was Turkish and I had never really given religion any validity or thought. After the breakup I went through a big change in the way I view religion and Spinoza was the stepping stone for that. At times I refer to myself as a pantheist, whether or not I am changes overtime but regardless I find Spinozas description of God quite compelling. 

For people not familiar with Spinoza's philosophy: God = the universe = the natural order. Everything, including your thoughts, actions, suffering, and joy, is part of God’s unfolding logic. There is no free will, only cause and effect.
