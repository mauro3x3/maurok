# Notes
Chapter 1: 

Ben Horowitz is from a different era but it's quite clear how 'nerdy' early Silicon Valley was - these people were math geniuses prior to any entrepreneurial success. 

Just before the chapter ends, he talks about the pivot NetScape was forced to make. To make a long story short, Microsoft copied their service but made it much cheaper and better. To be a thorn in Microsoft sides, Netscape did the same and made a cheaper version of Microsoft's original product. Sounds like geopolitics.

Horowitz on his relationship with Mark Andreessen: "People often ask me how we’ve managed to work effectively across three companies over 18 years. Most business relationships either become too tense to tolerate or not tense enough to be productive after a while. Either people challenge each other to the point where they don’t like each other or they become complacent about each other’s feedback and no longer benefit from the relationship. With Marc and me, even after 18 years, he upsets me almost every day by finding something wrong in my thinking, and I do the same for him. It works."

Chapter 3: 

Chapter 4: 

Chapter 4 is definitely the most productive chapter so far. I'd suggest skipping the first three, if you are solely reading the book for productivity gains.

1) Startup CEO’s shouldn’t play the odds. When you are building a company, you must believe there is an answer and you cannot pay attention to your odds of finding it. You just have to find it. It matters not whether your chances are nine in ten or one in a thousand; your task is the same.

2) Life is struggle

3) Don’t put everything on your shoulders. Nobody takes losses harder than the one most responsible. 

4) Play long enough and you might get lucky. This is true in any aspect of life!

5) Follow the principle of Bushido - the way of the warrior; keep death in mind at all times. If a warrior keeps death in mind at all times and lives as though this day might be his last, he will conduct himself properly in all manners. Same can be said about CEO’s and startups. 

6) The positivity delusion.
