The bible for startups in Silicon Valley. 

The first principles on (1) what to work on (2) how to work on it to create massive value and (3) how to capture part of the value to build a valuable company.

### My Notes 

IN PROGRESS

Historically speaking I wasn't the big booker reader (Wikipedia has always done the job) but Zero to One really changed my perspective. Besides being an amazing business book, it is a very easy to book for starters. Recently Peter Thiel appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience and shared a lot of the gems from Zero to One in a new format, updated and adjusted to the new status quo. I'd suggest watching the episode and making up your own mind, but I loved the focus on Mimetic theory. He's an OG student of Rene Girard after all.

Things that stuck with me from the book: 
1) Peter Thiel argues that we're regressing or at least are stagnant in the world of atoms. All of our growth the last decades have been fueled by growth in the world of bits, not atoms. An example of the regression in atoms is quite obvious - we've had nuclear since the early 50's and haven't progressed since the 70's. Imagine if we just did Nixon's plan. Another great example is travel. We had commercial airplanes in the 60's as well but the entire process has gotten signifinicantly slower post-911. I definitely agree with this sentiment.
2) The contrarian nature of Thiel. I'd like to think I share that trait with him. 
3)
