**Some things about me:**

- I'm a bachelor student at Aalborg University studying Business Administration and Commercial Law. When I graduate this summer I am planning to start my own business. What's the worst that could happen, getting a job?
- When I am not studying for school, I am working on bettering myself in the following fields: investing/excel, history, geopolitics, business, writing, gym or political prediction markets. 
- I am passionate about growth and learning new things. It's a dream of mine to start my own software company and make a positive impact on the world. I'll let my actions speak for themselves.
- My interests range across geopolitics, finance, political prediction markets, history, law, gym, religion, investing, technology, startups, and writing.

**Some goals of mine - maybe you can help me achieve any of these?**
- Visit the following countries [image](https://i.imgur.com/H6dQ6Do.png)
- Master Spanish, Russian and an additional language. Most likely Japanese or Arabic (5-6 languages total)
- Build a succesful software company with a positive impact on the world. 
- Write political books on topics like geopolitics, history, fertility, culture, business and future forecasting.
- Work in foreign policy, geopolitics, international relations or intelligence. 
- Experience working in a bank or a hedge fund - sounds like a fun challenge and a valuable experience.
