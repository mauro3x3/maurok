This book is for anyone underestimating Jeff Bezos. I have always found a lot of interest in him due to his childhood/ethnic background being relatively similar to mine. His ancestors are Danish peasants from the same island as my parents and he is raised by a Cuban stepfather (Essentially making him Danish and Cuban just like me..) 

Jeff Bezos is without a doubt one of the smartest people around. If you aren't a believer in wealth = intellect, all you need to confirm his intellect is taking a look at him ranking his teachers at the age of 6 and winning tons of competitions early on.

If you aren't much of a reader, I can strongly recommend the episode he did on Lex Fridman. It is one of the greatest podcasting episodes in history and a great introduction to the thinking of Bezos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcWqzZ3I2cY
