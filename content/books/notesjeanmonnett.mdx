IN PROGRESS
- This 'book' is a brief introduction to Jean Monnet but it's clear without a doubt Jean Monnet resembles the modern-day EU bureaucrat. 
- It's hard to know what to give him credit for and things to blame him for. The European Union is clearly as he envisioned, yet Europe is weaker than ever the more unified we have become. I don't think solely blaming the EU for this development is intellectually honest or benefical. 
- Jean Monnet died in 1979, so soon 50 years ago. Europe is incredibly different today than 50 years ago. The idealism hasn't held up to reality so far. 
- "The nations of Europe are too circumscribed to give their people the prosperity made
possible, and hence necessary, by modern conditions. They will need larger markets. And
they will have to refrain from using a major proportion of their resources to maintain
"key" industries needed for national defence and made mandatory by the concept of sovÂ·
ereign, protectionist States, as we knew them before 1939" - I fully agree with this sentiment but I don't think the EU has been able to deliver on this promise. Italian unification is comparable - idealist promise that didn't hold up to reality.
