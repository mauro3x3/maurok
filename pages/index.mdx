**Some things about me:**

- Currently taking my Master's in Business Law at Aalborg University.
- I am passionate about growth and learning new things. 
- My interests range across technology, geopolitics, finance, political prediction markets, history, languages, religion, investing and philosophy. 


<br />

**Some goals of mine - maybe you can help me achieve any of these?**
- Build a unicorn software company 
- Move to the US / East Asia (Bay Area or Miami preferably)
- Visit all countries + US states (Did the US east coast last year)
- Master Spanish and an additional language. Most likely Japanese or Arabic. I currently speak ~ 25-35 words in both of the two. (5-6 languages total) 
- Write books on topics like geopolitics, tech, history, fertility, culture, business and future forecasting. 
- Work in/with foreign policy (Perhaps in my 30's or 40's)
